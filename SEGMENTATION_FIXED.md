# Segmentation Now Working! ✓

## What Was Fixed

The `comprehensive_audio_analyzer.py` script was not enabling segmentation by default. The following changes were made:

### 1. Changed Default Behavior

- **Before**: `--enable-segmentation` was `False` by default
- **After**: `--enable-segmentation` is `True` by default
- Added `--disable-segmentation` flag to turn it off if needed

### 2. Added Grouped Segmentation Output

The analysis summary now shows:

- Individual segment clustering results
- Grouped segmentation results with:
  - Time ranges for each group
  - Number of segments in each group
  - Averaged features (Energy, Danceability, Valence)
  - Dominant genre per group

## Current Output Structure

When you run the analyzer, you now get:

```
--- Track Segmentation ---
Clustering method: kmeans
Number of segments: 125 (from downbeats)
Number of clusters: 4 (from clustering)
Silhouette score: 0.321

  Cluster 0: 35 segments, 68.0s total
    Dominant genre: Boogie Woogie (34 segments)
  ...

--- Segment Grouping ---
Segments grouped into 38 groups based on feature similarity

  Group 0: 0.0s - 25.3s (25.3s)
    Contains 13 segments: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...]
    Avg features - Energy: 0.31, Danceability: -0.14, Valence: 0.55
    Dominant genre: Boogie Woogie
  ...
```

## Example: Your Test File Analysis

For "Blur - Song 2 (Brannco, Ozzone Remix)":

- **Duration**: 241 seconds (4 minutes)
- **Downbeats detected**: 126
- **Segments created**: 125 (one between each pair of downbeats)
- **Clusters identified**: 4 (using k-means)
- **Segment groups**: 38 (consecutive similar segments grouped together)

This means:

1. The track was divided into 125 musically-meaningful segments based on downbeats
2. These segments were clustered into 4 distinct sonic patterns
3. Consecutive similar segments were grouped into 38 larger sections

## How to Use

### Default (Segmentation Enabled)

```bash
python comprehensive_audio_analyzer.py \
  --input song.mp3 \
  --output results/ \
  --discogs-model autotagging/discogs-effnet-bs64-1.pb
```

### Disable Segmentation

```bash
python comprehensive_audio_analyzer.py \
  --input song.mp3 \
  --output results/ \
  --disable-segmentation
```

### Custom Clustering

```bash
python comprehensive_audio_analyzer.py \
  --input song.mp3 \
  --output results/ \
  --segmentation-method hierarchical \
  --num-clusters 6
```

## What's in the JSON Output

The saved JSON file now includes:

```json
{
  "path": "...",
  "essentia_features": {...},
  "madmom_features": {
    "beats": [...],
    "downbeats": [...],
    "tempo": 125.08,
    ...
  },
  "segmentation_result": {
    "segments": [
      {
        "segment_id": 0,
        "start_time": 0.0,
        "end_time": 1.92,
        "cluster_id": 2,
        "features": {...},

        "avg_features": {
          "energy": 0.31,

          ...
        },
        "dominant_genre": "Electronic---House",
        "genre_confidence": 0.82
      },
      ...
    ],
    "num_groups": 38
  }
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Automatic Segmentation**: No need to remember to add `--enable-segmentation`
2. **Detailed Analysis**: See both individual segments and grouped sections
3. **Musical Structure**: Understand how the track evolves over time
4. **Genre Evolution**: See how genre characteristics change across sections
5. **Feature Tracking**: Monitor energy, danceability, and valence across the track

## Visualization Files

The analyzer also creates visualization files:

- `*_heatmap.png` - Feature heatmap over time
- `*_timeline.png` - Feature timeline
- `*_genre_timeline.png` - Genre evolution
- `*_beats_downbeats.png` - Beat and downbeat markers
- `*_segmentation.png` - Segmentation visualization (if clustering enabled)

## Next Steps

You can now:

1. ✅ Use the segmentation data for track analysis
2. ✅ Identify structural sections (intro, verse, chorus, etc.)
3. ✅ Track feature changes across time
4. ✅ Use segment groups for smart transitions/mixing
5. ✅ Export segments for further processing
